![melting wax sculpture of a head][splash]
Wax is a malleable material that provides the means for exploring creation while it is solid, and obliteration while it melts. This piece is a set of wax sculptures that are repeatedly melted back into their molds. 3D scans of the artists' heads were used to create wax sculptures. A suspended, rotating heat gone melts the wax back into its mold which encloses a 3D printed skull. When the head melts completely into the mold, the sculpture is removed from the mold and the melting process starts again.
