In this interactive, viewers use their hands to swirl pollen floating in the wind. The motion of the hands is captured by a Microsoft Kinect with OpenCV libraries and funneled in to a [Reynold's boid simulation] inspired by the behavior of pollen floating on the surface of Crater Lake in the late summer. The color palette was algorithmically generated based on a semester's study of the textbook [Generative Design].

This piece was inspired by [Avatar: The Last Airbender], the poignant children's TV series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. In the series, *benders* are people that use martial arts inspired movements to control the motion of the elements. These *benders* swirl air, stream water, lift rock, and launch fireballs as a seamless extension of their creative movement. The intuitive way *benders* manipulate their world was the inspiration behind the interface design of this interactive; and led us to try to capture 3D hand motion.
