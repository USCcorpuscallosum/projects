Andante used an Xbox Kinect to take in real time data of people’s heights and locations in a space, which were translated into a plethora of musical notes played at a variety of different rhythms. The Kinect is held down on a plank of wood via zip-ties and the wood was suspended from a ledge near the ceiling. Thus, the Kinect’s line of vision is straight down onto the floor. Code written in Java then split the field of vision into 8x8 squares, one of which corresponded to a note on the [tone matrix]. Varying heights were also considered; there were three ranges of heights made to correspond to different instruments (taken from different libraries in Java). The audience members were then able to construct musical tunes using their movements and spatial locations.
