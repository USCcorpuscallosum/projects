Using a micro-controller, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and LED strips, this skateboard was outfitted with turn signals and brake lights. A 3D printed case was created to house the micro-controller securely under the chassis of the skateboard. Additionally, the underside of the board was painted with an illustration.
