Part of Corpus Callosum's mission is to inspire members of our community to explore the creative aspects of engineering. Every year, Corpus Callosum exhibits some of its fun and interactive projects to hundreds of middle school and high school kids at the Armani Research Lab's [EngX event](http://armani.usc.edu/engx/). We volunteer in creating fun hands-on engineering demos for kids to play with, and try our best to show that engineering is a creative discipline.
