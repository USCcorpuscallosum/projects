Connected0 used an EEG headset to gather brain wave data from two people holding each other's gaze for 8 minutes. The data was interwoven with people’s fingerprint patterns to create a series of woodcut pieces representing how first impressions can leave an impact or “fingerprint” on people. The project was later featured at the [Angel City Brewery](http://angelcitybrewery.com/).
