In this interactive, viewers use their hands to move lightning across a screen. Versions were produced using a [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) and a Microsoft Kinect. The lightning algorithm was a study in recursive structures and a generative rain was applied to the background.

This piece was inspired by [Avatar: The Last Airbender], the poignant children's TV series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. In the series, *benders* are people that use martial arts inspired movements to control the motion of the elements. These *benders* swirl air, stream water, lift rock, and launch fireballs as a seamless extension of their creative movement. The intuitive way *benders* manipulate their world was the inspiration behind the interface design of this interactive; and led us to try to capture 3D hand motion.
